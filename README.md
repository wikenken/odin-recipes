# odin-recipes
Part of "The Odin Project" curriculum

This project aims me to use everything I've learned from previous lessons with primary focus on operating VSCode and applying basic HTML elements

End of Project reflections
I have to say when I was making this some part of it gets extremely repetitive. Especially when you're typing elements like <a>, <li>, etc. It was basically like that until I figured out you can skip most of that sharp bracket by just typing the letter and press tab. The program does that for you which I found extremely helpful.

Enabling auto-format on save is also nice to have, definitely won't unchecked this option ever.
